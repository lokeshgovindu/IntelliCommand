IntelliCommand
==============

Please check [DenGladkikh.IntelliCommand](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DenGladkikh.IntelliCommand) for Visual Studio 2010/2012/2013

IntelliCommand is a Visual Studio extension that helps you use keyboard shortcuts. It started as a hackathon project by a few devs on the Visual Studio team at Microsoft.

This extension is supported on Visual Studio 2022 Community of higher.

You can get the latest working version from the [Visual Studio Gallery][1].

The basics
----
IntelliCommand shows a helpful overlay window with all of the possible shortcuts you can use when you press Ctrl, Shift, Alt or any combination of those keys (hold the keys for 2 seconds to see the window). It also supports multi-key shortcut chords, so when you press the first key in a multi-key shortcut (like Ctrl+K, Ctrl+C), it shows you the possible next keys you can press and what they do.
